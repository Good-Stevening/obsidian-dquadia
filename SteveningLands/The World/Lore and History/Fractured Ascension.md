# **Fractured Ascension**

# **I. The Long Drift (Prehistory)**
> _“Before stars knew our name, we were dust and silence.”_
- The planet is a rogue world — a lonely traveler in the void.
- No sunlight, no seasons — only geothermal energy and possibly strange, pre-physical forces in the core.
- Visited by **The Architects** (ancient aliens). Their nature is **unknown** — physical, dimensional, AI, divine? They arrive briefly, build vast structures and systems (now buried or crumbled), and leave.
- What they leave behind: dormant **constructs**, **power sources**, or a **seeded core** intended to catalyze something later.
**People now mythologize this era as**:
- _“The Time of the One Flame”_ – a single divine being seeded creation
- _“The God Who Dreamed”_ – the world was born inside a god's sleep
- _“The Origin Veil”_ – creation shrouded in sacred obscurity
## **II. The Capture (Mythic Cataclysm)**
> _“The sky turned gold, and the deep heart of the world awoke.”_
- The planet is captured by a star system — possibly with help from alien tech (gravity wells, spatiotemporal anchors).
- Sunlight floods the world. A **planet-wide awakening** occurs:
    - Biology accelerates (life begins or mutates rapidly)
    - Alien structures reactivate in unpredictable ways
    - Something deep inside the world stirs (the _core engine_, _seed crystal_, or _divine memory_)
- **A handful of individuals** (maybe just 1-5) come into contact with this alien/divine power. They are transformed — uplifted, mutated, made into gods or demigods.
- These become the **First Divines**, **The Shattered Choir**, or **The Solar Heralds**.
**Myths depict this as**:
- _“The Ascension”_ – when mortals rose to meet the stars
- _“The Fracture of Flame”_ – the god splintered into many pieces
- _“The Coming of the Bright Ones”_ – first gods who brought fire, magic, or speech
## **III. The Shattering (The Fall of the First Divines)**
> _“Even fire that falls from heaven will cool to ash.”_
- A mysterious cataclysm occurs:
    - Infighting? Sacrifice? Cosmic recoil? External threat?
- The First Divines disappear, are destroyed, or **shatter** — their power fragments, dispersing across the world.
- Their temples collapse, their names blur or are erased, and **those who once worshipped them turn to others** who now channel small pieces of that legacy.
**This is the great theological wound** — the gods are dead, but their echoes remain.
**Today’s religions remember it as**:
- _“The Silence”_
- _“The Death of Light”_
- _“The Thousand Splinters”_
    - Some churches literally name their gods after shards (_Ivenari the Ember_, _Tyrius the Dawn-Shard_, etc.)
## **IV. The Age of Fragments (The Present)**
> _“What remains are echoes — bright, cruel, holy, or broken.”_
- Current gods are **mortals**, **spirits**, or **entities** that found or absorbed one or more **splinters** of the original divine/alien power.
- Worship, belief, and legacy amplify this power — in some cases shaping the identity of the being itself.
- No one is sure if _true godhood_ still exists, or if every deity is just a **carrier of broken fire**.
The setting now has:
- Doctrinal conflict: _“Is our god a true divine, or just a vessel?”_
- Relic-seeking factions trying to collect all the shards to **resurrect** the original god (or reawaken the alien system).
- Forgotten temples where **dead gods still whisper**.
- Magic as **refined divine residue** or **coded interface with alien relics**.
### Expansion Hooks
#### Factions & Faiths
- **The Keepers of the Flame**: Seek to **unify** the god-shards into a singular divine return.
- **The Pale Witnesses**: Believe the gods were **artificial**, and seek the truth behind the myths.
- **The Fractureborn**: Sorcerers who **wield raw shards** without reverence — dangerous, powerful, possibly unstable.
- **The Echoed Choir**: Priests who believe every person carries a tiny echo of divinity.
#### Relics & Magic
- “Divine Focuses” = alien-tech amplifiers or keys
- “Splinterstones” = physical shards of god-energy (or alien code-crystals)
- “Holy Sites” = terraformed nodes still resonating with deep energy
- “Void Ruins” = from the Drift Age, frozen crypts or machines left in darkness
#### Philosophical Conflicts
- Is godhood a natural evolution? A manufactured state? A contagion?
- Can splinters be reforged? If so, who gets to become the _One Returned_?
