# The Lithoforged
The dwarves trace their origin to a period long after the Ancients guided Celestareal into its star’s embrace. As the Seedworks awakened and life began to take root on the surface, the Makers turned their attention downward—into the deep places of the world, where heat, pressure, and volatile Lattice currents remained dangerously unstable.  
To maintain these foundations, they engineered a people capable of living where no other life could.

These were the Lithoforged, the first dwarves.
## Genesis Beneath the World
Unlike surface life—derived primarily from Seedworks genetic matrices adjusted for atmospheric conditions—the Lithoforged were created through hybrid synthesis.

Their bodies were formed using:
- bio-organic matter derived from Seedworks templates
- crystalline-lattice scaffolding taken from Maker machinery
- mineral-binding proteins designed to fuse biological tissue to stone-like densities

This resulted in a physiology no surface creature possessed:
- Core Dense Frame: Bones reinforced with silica, carbon lattice strands, and metamorphic compounds
- Heat Regulation: Hemoglobin variants capable of binding iron and copper simultaneously, transporting heat as efficiently as oxygen
- Pressure Tolerance: Micro-crystal fibers woven into connective tissue, allowing the body to disperse stress forces
- Geosense: Resonant organ clusters attuned to vibrations, granting dwarves the ability to feel stress fractures, voids, and magnetic shifts

The Makers intended them not as servants but as partners in stabilizing the new world they had reshaped.
## Purpose and the First Halls
The Lithoforged were instructed to maintain key subterranean systems:
- geothermal regulators
- pressure-dampening chambers
- Lattice insulation rings
- sub-crust resonance anchors

They moved through the deep mantle passages, reshaping raw stone with both tools and their bare hands.  
Their first “halls” were not dwellings but maintenance galleries, carved around nodes of Maker technology.

Yet as the centuries passed, the Lithoforged developed:
- language
- culture
- craft
- clan structures
- art, often expressed in stone relief and resonant song

They began carving living spaces near the working galleries, then meeting halls, then sanctuaries.  
Their cities grew organically—but always close to the deep-world systems they maintained.
## The Sundering of Purpose

When the Makers vanished, the Lithoforged were left with half-understood blueprints and ancient responsibilities. Some systems decayed; others operated automatically. Still others began to malfunction.

The Lithoforged split into two great traditions:
### The Rootbound
Those who believed their sacred duty was to continue the Makers’ work, maintaining the deep stabilizers at all costs.  
They became:
- somber
- dutiful
- deeply traditional

Their clans still reside close to the mantle, speaking softly so the world will “hear its own heartbeat.”
### The Hearthseekers
Those who believed their people deserved a life of their own, not eternal servitude to vanished creators.  
These dwarves moved upward, carving the first true dwarven kingdoms nearer to the surface.

They took with them:
- metallurgy
- geometric architecture
- the gift of deep sense
- Maker-inspired craft, transformed into cultural art

Most dwarves encountered on the surface descend from these Hearthseeker clans.
## Physiology of the Lithoforged
Dwarves remain fundamentally shaped by their engineered origins.
- Durability: Their bodies are compact and incredibly dense; a dwarf weighs roughly 1.5 to 2 times a human of similar height
- Longevity: Their cellular aging is slowed by mineral-binding organelles that continuously repair microfractures
- Resistance to Magic: Their woven crystal tissues dampen unstable Lattice surges, making dwarves naturally resilient to magical disruption
- Stone Affinity: Dwarven artisans are not merely skilled—stone itself responds subtly to their body’s resonant frequency

Scholars describe dwarves as “biometallic organisms,” though dwarven priests prefer the term Stoneblood.
## Cultural Inheritance
All dwarven cultures, whether Rootbound or Hearthseeker, preserve fragments of the Lithoforged legacy:
- The Deep Hymns—chant-songs originally used to synchronize work at geothermal stations
- Runic Geometry—a writing system derived from Maker diagnostics symbols
- The Forge Oath—a cultural mandate to create things that endure
- The Reverence of Structure—valuing stability, reliability, and integrity in people as much as in architecture

Even dwarven hospitality stems from their original design:

> A Lithoforged who found another in the deep shared water, warmth, and wayfinding—or both perished.

Generosity was survival; it later became tradition.
## Modern Dwarves
Today, few dwarves know the full truth of their origin. Most believe they were “shaped from stone by divine hands”—which is not incorrect, merely simplified.

Deep within certain mines lie sealed Maker galleries, still watched over by Rootbound descendants.  
Their existence explains dwarven suspicion of outsiders in the deep places: some secrets are too powerful, too old, and too dangerous to fall into careless hands.

Dwarves remain the world’s unwilling heirs to technologies no one truly understands.  
Their bodies remember tasks their culture has forgotten.  
Their blood still echoes with the hum of the world below.
