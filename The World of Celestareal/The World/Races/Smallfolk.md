# The Smallfolk
**The Smallfolk** are the shared ancestors of modern **Halflings** and **Gnomes**—a diminutive people remembered in story and song as gentle wanderers of the early world. Long before the first great kingdoms rose, before maps or roads or written chronicles, the Smallfolk moved lightly through the land’s meadows, hillvales, and underleaf groves. Their legacy survives not in ruins or monuments, but in traditions, habits, and the quiet resilience carried by their descendants.

## Origins and Nature
The Smallfolk are believed to have emerged in the sheltered lowlands formed during the planet’s early settling era, when Celestareal’s ecosystems were still stabilizing under new sunlight. Their bodies were compact and nimble, adapted to dense undergrowth and narrow burrows. Though physically modest, they possessed remarkable perceptiveness—an intuitive awareness of pattern, motion, and subtle magical resonance.

Legends describe them as “the people who listened to the land,” able to sense the humming harmonics of the world long before scholars understood such forces.
## Culture and Way of Life
Smallfolk communities were intimate, typically forming clusters of extended families called **circles**. These circles traveled seasonally, never ranging far but always drifting along familiar meadows, riversides, and forest borders. They left the land mostly as they found it, marking paths only with woven grass glyphs or small stone cairns.

Smallfolk valued:
- **Story-sharing over record-keeping**
- **Resourcefulness over wealth**
- **Comfort over conquest**
- **Cleverness over force**

Conflict was rare, for their societies prized wit and negotiation. Even predators were often avoided by cunning rather than combat.
## **The Divergence**
Over generations, the Smallfolk gradually split into two distinct peoples as the world expanded around them.
### **Halflings**
Halflings remained close to the soft lands—valleys, farms, riverbanks, and grasslands. They preserved the Smallfolk’s warmth, hospitality, and appreciation for simple pleasures. Their steadiness and community spirit are echoes of the old Smallfolk circles.
### **Gnomes**
Gnomes inherited the more curious, experimental side of Smallfolk nature. Drawn to the strange harmonics of alien ruins and the workings of natural phenomena, they adapted to varied terrain and embraced craft, invention, and arcane study.

Where Halflings embody the Smallfolk’s heart, Gnomes embody their spark.
## **Legacy**
Though the Smallfolk no longer exist as a unified people, their influence runs deep:
- Their **storycraft** is the root of Halfling folklore.
- Their **craftier traditions** underpin Gnomish tinker culture.
- Their **wander-circles** are echoed in both races’ communal structures.
- Their **animistic listening** to the world’s rhythms became early forms of primal magic.

To this day, Halflings and Gnomes can understand each other’s idioms and humor with uncanny ease—two branches of the same ancient tree.

The Smallfolk never built wonders or carved mountains, yet their quiet resilience shaped the early ages. Their legacy endures not in stone, but in the lives of the kindred races who inherited their gentle determination and boundless curiosity.
