# **Forgewater**

>_"_Under the perpetually overcast sky, Forgewater huddles between the silent sentinels of Mt. Ashenrise and Stonebreak Ridge, where the wind carries echoes of forgotten battles and ancient whispers._"_

> [!description] 
> Tucked in a narrow valley between two great peaks—**[[Mt. Ashenrise]]**, a long-slumbering volcano, and the ancient stone massif of **[[Stonebreak Ridge]]**—lies the mining town of **Forgewater**. Two rivers, born from snowmelt and deep mountain springs, rush down either flank of the valley, feeding a crystal-clear lake at the town’s heart before joining into a single river that flows south.
> 
> The town hums with the rhythm of industry. **Water wheels** creak and churn along the rivers, powering ore-crushers, mills, and forges. **Miners and metalworkers** make up most of the population, supported by **lumberers** from the nearby pine forest and **fisherfolk** who cast their nets into the cold, trout-filled lake.
> 
> Beneath Forgewater, deep shafts cut through ancient stone and ash, chasing veins of **iron**, **copper**, and **silver**—the backbone of the town’s economy and craft. Though the folk are hardy and practical, whispers abound of strange lights in the mines and old tunnels that dig far deeper than any record shows.
> 
> Forgewater is a place of **grit and myth**, where **stone and fire** meet, and where the **past is never entirely buried**.
