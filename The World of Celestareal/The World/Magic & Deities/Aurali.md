# Aurali
Inheritors of Fractured Divinity

> “Their light does not dim. It shatters only when broken.”

The Aurali are the second generation of divine beings—those who rose ages after the Makers perished in the cataclysm that ended the First Dawn. They are not true gods in the original sense, but vessels shaped by the fractured cores of the Makers, each carrying a shard of ancient, world-shaping power.

Mortals revere them as deities.  
Scholars fear them as anomalies.  
The Seedworks regards them as corrupted reflections of what should have been.
## Origins: Born of a Divine Explosion
When the Makers destroyed one another, their radiant cores ruptured. Each core held a complete domain—creation, storm, dream, decay, memory, and more.

When they burst, they did not release light.  
They released pieces of themselves.

Fragments embedded themselves across the world—  
in the land, in the oceans, in spirits, in living beings.

Any creature who absorbed a fragment was transformed into an Aurali:  
a new divine entity carrying only a fraction of a Maker’s original domain.

Unlike the Makers, they are not shaped by ancient design.  
They are shaped by the lives they lived before ascension.
## Nature: Stable but Volatile
The power of an Aurali does not fade with time.  
Fragments do not erode, weaken, or diminish.

Their divine spark is stable and self-sustaining—  
immortal unless destroyed.

But this stability is not safety.  
The fragment inside them is powerful, incomplete, reactive.  
It carries instincts of a dead god, pressure from a forgotten purpose, and echoes of the Maker’s final moments.

The dangers an Aurali faces come not from time, but from:
- contact with other fragments
- proximity to active Seedworks systems
- resonance with ancient Maker memories
- the strain of containing a piece of a dead god’s identity

Their power endures forever—  
but their existence is never simple.
## Domains: Shards of Lost Wholeness
Each Aurali governs a partial domain derived from the fragment they carry.
These domains are potent but incomplete:
- an Aurali of Storm may hold thunder, but not wind
- an Aurali of Death may shepherd souls, but not control life
- an Aurali of Knowledge may glimpse truth, but cannot reshape it

They do not wield total mastery over their domains.  
They wield the piece that survived.

This shapes religions, myths, and misunderstandings across the world.
## Forms and Minds
The Aurali vary drastically depending on what they were before ascension:
- mortals elevated into radiant forms
- beasts transformed into mythic guardians
- elemental spirits reshaped into divine intelligences
- abstract or conceptual beings given shape

Their personalities are a fusion of:
- their original nature
- the domain fragment’s instinct
- faint, distorted memories of a dead Maker

Some embrace their power.  
Some resist it.  
Some lose themselves to it.
## Relationship to Mortals
To mortals, the Aurali are gods—mysterious, unpredictable, and powerful.

But the Aurali themselves:
- remember their former mortality
- feel emotion, fear, attachment, and contradiction
- are not infinite, only ageless
- grapple with a role they did not choose

This leads to diverse relationships:
- benevolent guardians
- aloof observers
- tyrants reshaping nations
- wanderers avoiding worship
- scholars of their own existence
- manipulators seeking more fragments

They are divine, but never simple.
## Relationship to the Seedworks
The Seedworks is the skeleton of their origin—  
and the one thing the Aurali fear.

When an Aurali approaches an intact Seedworks node, they experience:
- overwhelming resonance
- flashes of ancient memory
- identity distortion
- psychological pressure
- the sense of being pulled toward a forgotten purpose

The Seedworks recognizes the fragment each Aurali carries,  
but sees it as an incomplete instance—  
a corrupted echo of the Makers.

Thus many Aurali forbid their followers from exploring deep ruins.  
Not to protect mortals, but themselves.
## Immortality and Risks
An Aurali does not fade.  
Their fragment does not weaken.  
They do not die of age.

But they can die.

Their true vulnerabilities include:
1. Fragment resonance: shards from the same Maker may react violently or draw Aurali toward conflict.
2. Fragment consumption: when Aurali clash, one may absorb another’s fragment, becoming stronger but more unstable.
3. Seedworks override: functioning chambers can suppress or annihilate a fragment.
4. Domain overload: pushing their domain too far can tear their physical vessel apart.
5. Sacrifice: an Aurali can burn themselves out to achieve a monumental act; the fragment survives, but the vessel does not.

Their power is eternal.  
Their survival is not.
## Divine Politics: Courts of Fractured Light
Because each Aurali holds an incomplete domain, they often form alliances called Courts.

Courts of Storm and Stone  
Courts of Tide and Shadow  
Courts of Seasons  
Courts of Stars  
(regional names vary widely)

These alliances are practical, fragile, and constantly shifting.  
They are not true pantheons—just uneasy truces.

Each Court hides truths about the Makers  
and dreads what mortals might discover if the past were fully unearthed.
## Role in the Modern Age
The Aurali influence the world both subtly and dramatically:
- anchoring magical laws
- guiding or manipulating cities, cultures, and heroes
- engaging in divine rivalries
- shaping prophecy and fate indirectly
- hunting for fragments to complete themselves
- suppressing or guarding knowledge of the Seedworks

They are the gods of the present era—  
but shaped by shrapnel from the age before them.

Their power endures eternally,  
but the consequences of it ripple across every age that follows.
