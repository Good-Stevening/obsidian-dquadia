# The Ancients

A mystical and mythical race of aliens who once visited the planet during its time as a rogue planet. 
Not much is known about these aliens, and while knowledge of them is long lost, the remnants of their power linger in the world in the form of ancient artefacts, long-lost ruins buried under millennia of entropy, and access to what most would classify as [[Magic]].
