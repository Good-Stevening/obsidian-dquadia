Magic is the visible consequence of a deeper truth: the world is still saturated with the broken essence of the Seedborn. When the First Gods vanished, their power did not depart with them—it splintered, diffused, and bled into every layer of reality. Every spell, every blessing, every whispered miracle is an interaction with these fractured currents.

Scholars call this ambient force **[[The Lattice]]**: an invisible weave of Seedborn residue threaded through matter, thought, and the dimensions beyond sight. While the Aurali embody concentrated shards of divine power, most creatures tap the Lattice only in fleeting or disciplined ways, resulting in the various forms of spellcasting recognized across the world.

Magic, as understood today, falls into several broad origins—each recognized by the world’s sages, yet all ultimately drawing from the same cosmic inheritance.
## Innate Magic
Some beings are born with a natural resonance to [[The Lattice]], their bloodlines shaped long ago by Seedborn experiments or by the lingering touch of ancient fragments. Sorcerers and magical creatures channel this power instinctively, their abilities shaped by personal emotion, instinct, or inherited attunement.
## Learned Magic  
Wizards and scholars manipulate the Lattice through method, geometry, and discipline. They see patterns the ancients left behind—mathematical echoes, structural rules, and blueprint-like sequences embedded in the fabric of things. For them, magic is discovery: an attempt to decode what the Seedborn never meant for mortals to understand.
## Pact-Bound Magic
Where the Seedborn vanished, new powers rose. Some are Aurali, some are remnants of Seedborn constructs, and others are entities born from the distortions of divine power gone astray. Those who form pacts draw strength from a will greater than their own, exchanging service for a share of concentrated fragment-energy.
## Divine Magic 
Clerics and paladins do not draw power from living gods—they draw it from **interpretation**. Faith aligns the caster’s heart with the echoes of a Seedborn fragment’s old purpose. When belief matches resonance, miracles occur. The power is real, though the gods may be long dead. Temples debate which doctrine is true… yet all miracles trace back to the same shattered origins.
## Primal Magic
The natural world absorbed enormous quantities of divine essence during the Fall. Forests, storms, oceans, and mountains hold their own memories of the Seedborn—distorted, but mighty. Druids and rangers call upon this lingering world-memory, awakening forces older than civilization, shaped by instinct rather than intellect.
## Psionic Magic
A rare and feared discipline, psionics arise where the mind becomes its own conduit. Instead of shaping the Lattice externally, psionic adepts fold reality inward, using thought and will alone. Many scholars believe psionic power comes from fragments that broke too deeply, embedding themselves in consciousness rather than matter.

Magic functions reliably for most spellcasters, yet its deeper nature remains unstable. Wild zones near the Seedworks, ruins, or fragment-saturated regions behave unpredictably, twisting spells or amplifying them beyond intent. Some Aurali regard these fluctuations as signs that the world is still evolving—that the divine lattice has not yet settled since the First Gods departed.

To practice magic is to participate in a cosmic legacy left unfinished. Every spell is a reminder that the gods who shaped the world are gone… yet their touch lingers in every stone, breath, and heartbeat.
