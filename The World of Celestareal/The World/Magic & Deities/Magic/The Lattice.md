# The Lattice
#magic 
The Lattice is the underlying metaphysical field permeating the world, created when the Seedborn’s divine essence fractured and diffused into the planet during the Fall. Though once purely supernatural, the Lattice now behaves as a natural force, similar in reliability to gravity or electromagnetism. Scholars classify it as a consciousness-reactive field: it responds to intention, structure, and meaning, while still adhering to measurable rules.

Every spell, magical effect, Nehini, or Aurali manifestation is ultimately an interaction with the Lattice. It is not a source of power itself, but a medium through which Seedborn residue expresses itself.
## Structure and Behavior
The Lattice is composed of countless interwoven filaments of fractured essence. These filaments are invisible, intangible, and undetectable by mundane senses, yet they interact with matter, energy, and consciousness in predictable ways.

The field varies in density. Regions with ancient Seedborn activity, geological anomalies, strong cultural traditions, or heavy emotional resonance tend to exhibit higher concentrations. In such places, magic becomes easier, Nehini more active, and reality more fluid in response to will.
## The Three Pillars of Lattice Interaction
Arcane researchers categorize Lattice behavior using three principles:

Resonance  
The Lattice vibrates in response to intention, symbolic patterns, and emotional force. Spellcasting harnesses resonance deliberately; Nehini are born from naturally occurring resonant structures.

Conduction  
Certain materials, locations, or individuals conduct Lattice energy more efficiently. Crystalline growths, ancient monuments, and fragments embedded in the bloodlines of sorcerers are examples of high-conduction phenomena.

Stability  
Magical effects persist only when the surrounding Lattice remains stable. Disrupted or turbulent regions cause spells to warp, fail, or behave unpredictably. Stability can be influenced by geography, emotional events, fragment awakenings, or celestial alignments.
## Interaction with Magic
Every magical tradition interfaces with the Lattice differently:
- Arcane magic manipulates resonance using form, geometry, and precision.  
- Divine magic aligns personal belief with Seedborn echoes embedded in the field.  
- Primal magic attunes to ecological expressions of the Lattice—weather, cycles, and migration patterns.  
- Psionic magic interacts directly through thought, bypassing symbolic structures altogether.
Regardless of method, the Lattice is always the medium.
## Scientific Understanding
Modern scholars treat the Lattice as a branch of natural philosophy. Instruments exist that can detect fluctuations, predict magical storms, or identify fragment-rich zones. Cities with arcane universities map local Lattice topology to prevent hazardous resonance buildups. Field researchers have even discovered that the Lattice responds to collective emotion, creating measurable changes during festivals, wars, or mass grief.

Despite this progress, the origin of the Lattice—its Seedborn nature—remains poorly understood. Some theories suggest it is a controlled system the Seedborn used to shape worlds. Others believe it is the unstable byproduct of their destruction.

Whatever its purpose, it is now woven into every law of the planet. Life evolved around it. Civilization depends on it. And fragments—whether in Aurali or hidden in the world—continue to reshape its structure.
## Role in the Current Age
The Lattice is not static. As fragments shift, awaken, or clash, the entire field can reconfigure across continents, altering magic, creating new Nehini, or destabilizing regions. Aurali interactions can reshape the Lattice dramatically, sometimes accidentally.

The world stands in a dynamic balance, influenced by ancient forces and modern minds—its reality flexible, yet governed by consistent principles that scholars and adventurers continue to uncover.
