# Makers
The Makers were the first beings to rise from the Ancients’ work on Celestareal. Created or awakened within the Seedworks, they were designed to shepherd the life and energy the Ancients had planted, shaping the early world with intelligence and power beyond mortal comprehension.

Though often called gods by later generations, the Makers were not omnipotent. They were semi-divine entities, immortal and extraordinarily powerful, yet fundamentally tied to the planet, its Seedworks, and the Lattice.
## Origins
When the Ancients planted the Seedworks and began experimenting with life, they also developed methods to instill consciousness and agency into the first “divine” beings. These entities were born from combinations of biology, Seedborn energy, and the Lattice itself.

The Makers were designed to be self-sustaining, capable of growth, adaptation, and oversight of the ecosystems and civilizations the Ancients intended to flourish. Some were given domains such as creation, death, memory, or natural forces; others embodied concepts such as balance, order, or conflict.
## Nature and Power
- **Semi-divine**: They carried a concentrated portion of Seedborn essence, making them immensely powerful yet limited to the parameters of their design.
- **Immortal but not invincible**: They could only be destroyed by catastrophic events or by one another.
- **Domain-driven**: Each Maker was associated with a specific aspect of the world, which they shaped directly through their will and their Lattice connection.
- **Planet-bound**: While the Ancients could leave Celestareal, the Makers were inextricably tied to the planet’s Seedworks.
## The First Dawn
Over millennia, the Makers grew in power, autonomy, and ambition. Conflicts eventually arose—sometimes over ideology, sometimes over territory or purpose. These disputes culminated in the First Dawn, a cataclysmic series of conflicts that destroyed many Makers and shattered the cores of those who remained.

The remnants of their power dispersed as fragments, embedding themselves across the planet. These shards are the origin of all Aurali and many phenomena in the modern age. The death of the Makers also ended direct oversight of life on Celestareal, leaving the world to evolve on its own.
## Legacy
The Makers’ influence continues indirectly through:
- **Aurali**: Vessels of their fragmented power, inheriting partial domains and echoes of the Makers’ will.
- **Nehini**: Some are shaped or guided by the lingering influence of a Maker’s domain.
- **The Lattice**: Their connection to Seedborn energy helped structure and stabilize the Lattice across the planet.
- **Mortals and myths**: Cultures often misinterpret their deeds as divine will or legend, forgetting the Makers’ original origin as creations themselves.
## Perception in the Modern Age
Mortals rarely know the true nature of the Makers. Some revere them as gods, others fear them as ancient tyrants, and scholars debate whether they were alive, intelligent machines, or hybrids of biology and energy. The truth—that they were semi-divine entities created by the Ancients to guide the world—remains a guarded secret, hinted at only by ruins, Seedworks nodes, and the surviving fragments that became the Aurali.

Though gone, the Makers’ echo remains in every shard of Aurali power, every pulse of the Lattice, and every place where life and consciousness flourish, subtly directing the planet according to a will that once belonged to beings long dead.
