## Ancients
The Ancients are the original civilization that arrived on Celestareal during the Long Drift. They are **mortals (or at least corporeal beings) of extreme intelligence and technological capability**, capable of shaping planets, seeding life, and manipulating matter and energy on a planetary scale. Their “powers” appear godlike because their understanding of physics, biology, and energy far surpasses mortal comprehension—but they are still fundamentally physical beings with bodies, technology, and society.
- They are explorers, creators, and experimenters.
- They design and build the Seedworks, Lattice nodes, and life-seeding systems.
- Their influence on the planet is indirect through technology, constructs, and the life they seeded.
- They can be studied scientifically (in principle) because they follow consistent natural laws, even if highly advanced.
## Makers
The Makers are the **first entities to rise from the Seedworks**—the beings that the Ancients essentially “engineered” to be divine. They are **semi-divine, conscious constructs** created with both technology and the Ancients’ manipulation of life and Lattice energy.
- They were the first true “gods” of the planet, alive with concentrated Seedborn energy.
- Unlike the Ancients, the Makers are no longer mortal; they were designed to exist as immortal, super-powered beings.
- Their purpose included shepherding life, enforcing order, or fulfilling whatever the Ancients intended.
- They eventually entered conflict, which led to their destruction or disappearance.
- The shards of their fractured power became the fragments that later formed the Aurali.
## Key Differences

|Aspect|Ancients|Makers|
|---|---|---|
|Nature|Advanced mortals / civilization|Seedworks-born semi-divine entities|
|Origin|From outside Celestareal|Created on Celestareal from Seedworks and Ancients’ work|
|Purpose|Explore, shape, and seed life|Maintain, guide, and “divine” life|
|Mortality|Mortal (albeit long-lived)|Immortal until destroyed|
|Power|Technology and biology (science-based)|Concentrated divine fragments (supernatural)|
|Fate|Left the planet, vanished from history|Destroyed/fragmented in divine conflicts (First Dawn)|
|Legacy|Structures, Seedworks, Lattice|Fragments leading to Aurali|

In short: the **Ancients are the architects and scientists**, the “engineers” of the world, while the **Makers are the first divinely powered offspring of their experiments**, the semi-gods who directly shaped early life and set the stage for divine politics, the Aurali, and the Lattice’s metaphysics.

# Celestareal Divine Hierarchy

## 1. Ancients
- **Nature:** Advanced mortal civilization, highly intelligent and technologically sophisticated.
- **Role:** Architects of the world; seeded life, built the Seedworks, and embedded the Lattice.
- **Power:** Science and advanced technology indistinguishable from magic.
- **Legacy:** Structures, planetary-scale constructs, Seedworks, and Lattice framework.
- **Fate:** Left the planet or vanished from history.
↓
## 2. Makers
- **Nature:** First beings created from Seedworks and Ancients’ engineering; semi-divine, immortal.
- **Role:** Shepherded early life, enacted the Ancients’ plans, shaped the first civilizations.
- **Power:** Concentrated Seedborn energy; godlike abilities.
- **Legacy:** Their fractured cores became the source of Aurali power.
- **Fate:** Destroyed in the First Dawn; cores shattered.
↓
## 3. Aurali
- **Nature:** Vessels of fragments of Makers’ cores; partially divine.
- **Role:** Current divine figures, rulers of regions, patrons, and manipulators of mortal affairs.
- **Power:** Partial domains of the original Makers’ abilities; stable, transferable with difficulty.
- **Legacy:** Anchor magic, maintain religion, influence civilizations, and stabilize or reshape regions.
- **Fate:** Alive in the present age; mortal politics, conflict, and Seedworks interaction remain threats.
↓
## 4. Nehini
- **Nature:** Emergent spirits formed from Lattice interactions and environmental resonance.
- **Role:** Guardians of places, ideals, and natural phenomena; localized spiritual presence.
- **Power:** Limited, domain-specific, responsive to continued significance and environmental stability.
- **Legacy:** Influence local culture, traditions, and ecosystems.
- **Fate:** Persist as long as their domain continues to matter; can fade if forgotten.
## Hierarchy Summary
- **Ancients:** The original architects, mortal but capable of godlike feats.
- **Makers:** Semi-divine entities born from the Ancients’ work, now extinct.
- **Aurali:** Inheritors of the shattered divine power of the Makers; currently active.
- **Nehini:** Spirits arising organically from the world and its Lattice; locally influential.
