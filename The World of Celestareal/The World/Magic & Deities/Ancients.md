# The Ancients
#lore
The Ancients are the original architects of life on Celestareal and the progenitors of the powers that would later fragment into the Aurali. Their civilization predates the stars’ naming and the earliest reckoning of time, leaving behind monuments, artifacts, and technologies that modern scholars struggle to comprehend. In the present age, they are known only through myth, ruin, and the lingering imprint of their works.

The Ancients are not deities in the traditional sense. They are a species or civilization of extraordinary intelligence and capability, capable of manipulating matter, energy, and life on a planetary scale. Their technology appears godlike because it operates at levels far beyond current mortal understanding, blending science and principles we would consider arcane.
## Origins and Nature
The Ancients emerged from a distant region of the galaxy, traveling across the void with purposes that remain mysterious. They possessed the knowledge to shape planets, seed life, and embed durable frameworks of energy—later called the Lattice—into the worlds they touched.

Their motives are largely speculative. Some scholars argue they were experimenters, seeking to observe life in diverse conditions. Others suggest they were creators, leaving behind legacies meant to guide future civilizations. Conflicts within their civilization may have mirrored or exceeded the scale of mortal wars, but records are lost.
## Works and Influence
The Ancients left behind structures and devices of impossible scale:
- Monolithic seed chambers buried deep beneath the planet’s crust, which would eventually give rise to the first Aurali and other sentient life.
- Planet-spanning conduits and nodes that regulate and shape the Lattice.
- Artifacts and constructs that still function, often without clear purpose, appearing magical to mortals.

These remnants have influenced the development of life and civilization on Celestareal, shaping geography, ecology, and the eventual emergence of the Aurali and Nehini.
## The Makers and the Fall
Some of the beings created or nurtured by the Ancients rose to godlike prominence and became known as the Makers. These early divine entities inherited aspects of Ancient power but eventually entered conflict, culminating in the First Dawn—the cataclysmic event that shattered their cores and fractured their essence across the world. The death and dispersal of the Makers effectively ended direct Ancient influence, leaving only residual energy, artifacts, and the Lattice to shape the planet.
## Legacy
The Ancients are the origin point of all current divine phenomena on Celestareal. They left behind:
- [[The Lattice]], the fundamental field through which magic operates.
- [[Seedworks]], subterranean systems that continue to influence life and power.
- Cultural echoes in mortal myth, ritual, and architecture.
- Fragments of divine energy that would become the Aurali.

Despite their absence, the Ancients’ presence continues to shape civilization. Every technological wonder that seems impossible, every spell that bends the rules of matter, and every Nehini born of the land’s resonance can trace its origin back to the Ancients.
## Perception in the Modern Age
Mortals rarely understand the Ancients for what they were. Some worship their works as divine relics, while others study them scientifically. Aurali often recognize remnants of their influence instinctively, treating Seedworks nodes or Ancient constructs with caution. Scholars theorize that certain active nodes and the Myelin Core are still performing functions for which even the Ancients themselves may have forgotten the purpose.

Though gone, the Ancients remain the hidden architects of reality, their designs still humming beneath the surface of the world, waiting for the day someone or something might fully awaken them.
