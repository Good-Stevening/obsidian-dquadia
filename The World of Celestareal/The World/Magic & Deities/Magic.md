# Magic

Magic in this world is not divine by origin—but the lingering echo of a power left behind by the long-vanished **[[The Ancients|Ancients]]**. What many call “magic” is, in truth, the residue of their forgotten technology—an energy that still permeates the world.

Some few scholars grasp fragments of its true, scientific nature, striving to rediscover its origins. Others revere it as a sacred force, a divine gift from gods or spirits.

In truth, this power may stem from an ancient machine buried deep within the planet’s core—still active, still radiating its influence—or perhaps the planet itself was forever changed by the Ancients’ passing, infused with a power that now fuels the arcane.

Spellcasters may interpret and interact with magic in different ways, depending on their nature and origin. Here are some common examples:
- **Wizards** harness magic through study and discipline, learning to access and manipulate its flow through rigorous training and understanding.
- **Sorcerers** are born with an innate connection to magic, instinctively knowing the gestures, words, and focus required to cast spells without formal education.
- **Warlocks** gain magical power through contact with powerful entities—either by forging pacts or being altered by proximity to raw cosmic force—channeling spells through that bond.
- **Bards** weave magic into their performance, channeling spells through music, speech, movement, and storytelling, turning expression into arcane influence.
- **Paladins** awaken their magical ability upon taking a sacred oath, drawing divine power from their unwavering conviction and moral purpose.
- **Clerics** access magic through faith, devotion, or ritual, often manifesting spells as a reflection of their connection to a higher power or spiritual truth.

• Aether Resonance – The planet’s crust pulses with an energy called Aether, concentrated along ancient ley lines that trace back to the convergence event. Spellcasting requires attuning oneself to these resonances.

• Relic Attunement – Artifacts from the Ascendants serve as focal points for magical power. Their activation often demands a ritual that echoes their original purpose—whether drawing energy from geothermal vents or interfacing with cosmic frequencies.

Magic in Celestareal adheres to “natural laws” of its own—laws that are both mysterious and grounded in the planet’s unique history. Mastery comes not only from innate talent but also from understanding the interplay between tectonic energies, relic vibrations, and cosmic cycles.
