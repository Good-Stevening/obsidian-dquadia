## The Long Drift (Prehistory)
> _“Before stars knew our name, we were dust and silence.”_

Eons before history, before constellations took shape or memory found purchase, the world wandered—a lonely ember flung from some forgotten catastrophe. It drifted for ages uncounted, wrapped in night so complete that even time failed to notice it. No sun claimed it. No life softened its frozen skin. It was an empty stone, unobserved and unremarkable.

**Until the sky broke open.**

From beyond the rim of mapped existence came the beings now remembered only as the **[[Ancients]]**—a civilization so old that even their ruins predate mortal conceptions of time. Their vessels eclipsed the horizon like moving stars; their language was a hum that shook mountains. Whether they were explorers, gardeners of worlds, refugees, or something else entirely… no surviving myth agrees.

But they acted.
### The Reshaping
With tools that bent geometry and melted stone like wax, the Ancients carved enigmatic structures into the planet’s crust—monoliths that drink starlight, spiraling vaults of alloy unknown to modern craft, subterranean channels that pulse faintly even now.

Some say these were laboratories. Others argue they were temples, machines, or wounds. The truth may be all of these at once.
### The Seedworks
Deep beneath the surface, the Ancients laid their greatest work:  
**the [[Seedworks]]**, a lattice of chambers filled with stasis-pods grown from living metal. Each pod held a dormant form—early life, proto-creatures, or raw biological templates waiting for the right dawn.

These were not creations of nature but artifacts of intent.

Scholars  debate what the Ancients meant to shape: servants, successors, test subjects, or children.
### The Course Correction
In their final act, the Ancients altered the planet’s destiny.  
They harnessed stellar gravity as if it were twine, tugging the rogue world from its dead drift and setting it on a path toward a young, golden star. Such intervention should have shattered continents. Instead, the world glided as if obeying a long-forgotten promise.

When the work was done, the Ancients vanished—whether by departure, dissolution, or extinction is unknown. Only their relics endured, humming faintly beneath the crust.
### The Stirring
Now, as the world crosses the threshold of warmth and light, the [[Seedworks]] awaken. The pods hum with ancient energy. Shapes stir within their translucent shells.

The first breaths of life echo through chambers older than civilization.

This is the ending of one age—the Long Drift—  
and the quiet prologue to all that will come.
## The First Dawn (The Age of Makers)
> _“They rose from metal wombs and breathed purpose into dust.”_

When the pods of the Seedworks unfurled, they did not release beasts nor mortals, but something stranger— 
**the Makers**, the first great minds to walk the newborn world.

Born of Ancient design yet shaped by the world’s own newborn energies, they emerged radiant with abilities mortals would later mistake for divinity. They spoke in harmonics that could coax rivers into new paths. Their hands sculpted forests, their breath seeded storms, and their thoughts gave form to the first living beings that walked under the warming sun.

Where the Makers stepped, life blossomed. Creatures rose from their crafted soils, ecosystems spun into balance, and the world—once barren—awakened into color and motion.
### The Era of Harmony
For ages uncounted, the Makers ruled not as tyrants but as gardeners.  
Each tended a region of the forming world, guiding climates, species, and early civilizations. Though distinct in temperament—some gentle, some fierce, some distant—they shared purpose, bound by the resonant song still humming in their Seedwork-forged hearts.

Mortals later called this time **the First Dawn**, when creation itself seemed to bloom endlessly.
### The Breaking of Accord
But all gardens, given time, sprout shadows.

As life multiplied, so too did difference: in philosophy, in desire, in interpretation of the Ancients’ forgotten intent. Whispers spread among the Makers—questions left unanswered by their creators.

Why were we shaped?  
To preserve? To surpass? To replace?

Divergence hardened into factions. Factions calcified into rivalry. And rivalry, when fueled by near-divine power, erupted into a conflict that tore at the seams of the world.
### The Fall of the Makers
The war of the Makers was not one of armies, but of principles made manifest. Mountains cracked under clashing wills. Seas boiled. Skies dimmed. Each Maker, in their struggle, poured out their luminous core—the very energy that tethered them to the Seedworks.

One by one, the Makers vanished:  
some slain, some consumed by the powers they wielded, and some simply… gone, leaving only silence where once creation had sung.

Their monuments collapsed. Their shapes faded from memory.  
Thus ended the First Dawn, leaving the world wounded yet alive—a world that had already forgotten the hands that shaped it.
### The Fracture
But the Makers’ power did not die with them.

When their luminous cores were torn asunder, the energies within did not return to the Seedworks. Instead, they shattered—sparks scattering into the world like falling stars, sinking into earth, sea, sky, and flesh.

Centuries passed before anyone discovered what those fragments had become.
### The Rise of the Aurali
In ages long after the Makers’ disappearance, new beings began to manifest strange echoes of the old power—lesser in scope, but potent enough for mortals to call them gods.

These inheritors, touched by fragments of broken divinity, came to be known as the **Aurali**.

Not born from the Seedworks but awakened by its remnants, the Aurali wield shards of the Makers’ former might. Each holds a different fragment—some tied to storms, some to growth, some to death, memory, or hidden realms. Unlike the Makers, they are not unified. They rise dispersed, shaped not by the Ancients’ intent but by the accidents of where the divine fragments fell.

In them, mortals found protectors, tyrants, muses, and mysteries.

And in their fractured ascension, a new era began—  
one built not on the harmony of creation,  
but on the unpredictable inheritance of a broken legacy.
