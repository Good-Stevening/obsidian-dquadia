# Disclaimer
gameplay-wise, “Anything goes” ---though we might not agree with certain topics that are wrong, things may happen in game that we do not condone in real life. 
I want it to be clear that these ‘taboo’ topics can certainly be found in this world, and may be encountered by the player characters. 
If you have certain topics like these, such as, but not limited to, violence, gore, sexism, sex, dismemberment, rape, etc.., this may not be the game for you.
That being said, the players are supposed to be the "good guys", and as such, I expect the players to do what is deemed "good" generally, though I certainly expect intricacies and deviance in player character motivations to do whatever quests is laid before them, but there should be no "murder-hobos", or generally player characters following an "evil" path.
# Drinking Potions
In the 2024 5e rules, drinking or feeding a potion is a bonus action, and you roll for restored HP. House rule: if you take an action to drink your health potion, you get the maximum amount of HP from it restored. This can be explained that if you take an action, you assure that you drink the whole potion, where as if you take a bonus action, you may be rushed, and may not get the full content in your, or whomever you're feeding the potion to, mouth.
# Drawing and Sheathing Weapons
Weapons can be sheathed as a free action, though equipping shields and unequipping them still count as an action, since they are armour with the donning and doffing rules.
# Inspiration
You may choose to roll your inspiration roll after seeing the result of the roll, but before knowing the outcome.
# Exhaustion when downed
When reduced to 0 HP, you gain a point of exhaustion.
# Death
If your character fails three death saes, or would otherwise die, if the situation allows for it, if the DM agrees, you may instead receive a permanent disabling wound, such as losing the use of an arm, or going blind. This is to be discussed with the DM, and should be plausible. It is very unlikely to survive a fall from certain distances, for example, so this rule is always meant to be seen as "within reason". Wrong or over use of this rule may make character death trivial.
# Help Action
You can only use the Help action for skills you are proficient with.
# Max Extra Crit Dice
Any dice you would normally get to roll as 'extra' dice because of a critical hit, automatically have the maximum value. This only applies to the extra dice, not the regular attack dice.
# PVP Combat
PVP is discouraged, and as a general rule, if you decide to initiate PVP, the targetter player gets to go first and decides the action, if **all** players are in agreement to engage in PVP, there may be exceptions to this rule.
# Coyote time
Whenever a creature would fall 10 feet or more, instead of falling instantly, the creature can choose to delay its fall until the end of its next turn, or its current turn, whichever comes first.
