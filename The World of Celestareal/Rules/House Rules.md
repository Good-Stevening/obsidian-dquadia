# Gameplay Philosophy: A World of Complexity
In this game world, the motto is “Anything goes”—narratively speaking. While we may encounter themes or situations that challenge our real-world values, it's important to remember that this is a fictional setting designed to explore a wide range of experiences and moral dilemmas.

Some storylines may touch on mature or controversial topics such as violence, gore, sexism, sexuality, and dismemberment. If these themes are uncomfortable or distressing for you, this may not be the ideal game experience.

That said, players are expected to embody characters who strive to be the "good guys." While nuanced motivations and morally gray decisions are welcome and encouraged for depth, the overall tone should lean toward heroism and integrity. This is not a game for "murder-hobos" or characters who pursue wanton cruelty or evil for its own sake.
# Potion Efficiency Based on Action Type
In accordance with the 2024 5e rules, drinking or administering a potion is typically a bonus action, and the healing effect is determined by rolling the appropriate dice.

However, under this house rule, if a player chooses to use their action to drink or feed a healing potion, they receive the maximum possible healing from that potion.

*Why?* 
Taking an action represents a deliberate, focused effort—ensuring every last drop of the potion is consumed properly. In contrast, using a bonus action implies haste or distraction, which might result in a partial dose or spillage during the chaos of combat.

This rule rewards tactical choices and adds a layer of realism to potion use, encouraging players to weigh urgency against effectiveness.
# Drawing and Sheathing Weapons
- Sheathing a weapon is a free action.
- Equipping or doffing a shield requires an action, as shields are considered armour and follow donning/doffing rules.
# Inspiration
You may choose to use Inspiration after seeing the result of your roll, but before knowing the outcome. This allows for more strategic use without removing the element of suspense.;
# Exhaustion When Downed
When a character is reduced to 0 HP, they gain 1 point of exhaustion. This reflects the toll of near-death experiences and encourages caution in combat.
# Death and Disabling Injuries
- If your character fails three death saving throws or would otherwise die, the DM may offer an alternative: a permanent disabling wound (e.g., blindness, loss of limb).
- This option is only available if the situation plausibly allows survival, and must be agreed upon with the DM.
- This rule is meant to preserve drama and realism—not to trivialize death. Overuse may undermine its impact.
# Help Action
You may only use the Help action for skills in which your character is proficient. This ensures that assistance is meaningful and grounded in character expertise.
# Max Extra Crit Dice
- When scoring a critical hit, any extra dice granted by the crit (e.g., Sneak Attack, Divine Smite) are treated as maximum value.
- This applies only to the extra dice, not the base weapon damage dice.
# PVP Combat
- Player vs. Player combat is discouraged.
- If a player initiates PVP, the targeted player acts first and chooses their response.
- Exceptions may apply only if all players agree to engage in PVP under different terms.
# Coyote Time (Falling Delay)
- When a creature would fall 10 feet or more, they may choose to delay the fall until the end of their current turn or the end of their next turn, whichever comes first.
- This allows for cinematic moments and last-second saves.
